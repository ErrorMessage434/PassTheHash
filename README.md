# PassTheHash
what I learned after performing pass the hash on a live FreeRDP ping server is that there is relatively easy access to company exploitation if the user data is infiltrated from just using a sample hash or better called the empty hash. The Hash we pass is used to authenticate through a user server which can possibly be affiliated with a company.
